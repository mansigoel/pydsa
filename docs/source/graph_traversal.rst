Graph Traversal
===============

In computer science, graph traversal (also known as graph search) refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are visited. Following is the list of graph traversal algorithms which are implemented in Pydsa.
